# Kegerator Project

## Overview
This project involves taking a kegerator and integrating it with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to monitor temperature and flow. The system will be based on the open-source [Kegbot project](https://kegbot.org/), which allows for easy customization and data tracking. The completed project will allow for precise control over the serving temperature and amounts of your favorite draft beers.
